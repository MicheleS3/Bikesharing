# Bikesharing

### Overview

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

### Results

The majority of men ride the bikes for 20-50 minutes each time.  Women ride consistantly for about 30 minutes.  The unknown rides ride for about 20-30 minutes.

The bikes are used mostly early morning and early evenings during the work week.  The usage picks up during the day on weekends.

As you can see men use the bike-sharing program weekdays before and after work as well as all day on weekends.  The unknown users seem to follow the same pattern of usage as the males.

### Summary

Based on these results men seem to be the ones who use the bikes the most during the week to go to and from work as well as ride on the weekends.  Men are also the main subscribers of the bike-sharing program.  This would be a great program for Des Moines to implement this program.  Some suggested additional research would be to see where largest population lives and their commute to see the best placement of the bike terminals.  The marketing would be best towards men and tourist attractions.
